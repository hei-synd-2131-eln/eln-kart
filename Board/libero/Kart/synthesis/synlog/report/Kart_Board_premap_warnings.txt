@W: MT462 :"c:\dev\eln_kart_sodimm200\kart\board\concat\kart.vhd":418:4:418:5|Net I21.Q appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. If this is a required clock, declare a clock constraint on this net in your constraint file.
@W: MT532 :"c:\dev\eln_kart_sodimm200\kart\board\concat\kart.vhd":3326:4:3326:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 3 sequential elements including I_board.I_sensorsController.I_regs.g0\.1\.U_endsEdges.pulse_delayed.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT530 :"c:\dev\eln_kart_sodimm200\kart\board\concat\kart.vhd":1161:4:1161:5|Found inferred clock Kart_Board|clock which controls 1036 sequential elements including I_board.U_0.U_0.U_1.register_input\.p_registers_0[15:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may adversely impact design performance.
